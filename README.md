The purpose of the application is to create an automated system to automatically manage the parking lot and maintain a website with detailed statistics about the system.

The functionality of the system includes:

* determination of the approximate position of the car in the surroundings of the tollbar by using sensors
* automatic barrier management
* handling both card and cash payments
* collecting, archiving and visualizing data regarding functioning of the automatic parking system (current parking occupancy, number of customers on a given day, etc.)
